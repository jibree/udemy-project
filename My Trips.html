            <h2>Venice,Italy</h2>
            <div id="description-paragraph">
                <p>Venice, Italian Venezia, city, major seaport, and capital of both the provincia (province) of Venezia and the regione (region) of Veneto, northern Italy.
                An island city, it was once the centre of a maritime republic. It was the greatest seaport in late medieval Europe and the continent's commercial and cultural link to Asia.
                Venice is unique environmentally, architecturally, and historically, and in its days as a republic the city was styled la serenissima ("the most serene" or "sublime"). 
                It remains a major Italian port in the northern Adriatic Sea and is one of the world's oldest tourist and cultural centres.
                </p>
                <p>Since the fall of the Venetian republic in 1797, the city has held an unrivaled place in the Western imagination and has been endlessly described in prose and verse.
                   The luminous spectacle of ornate marbled and frescoed palaces, bell towers, and domes reflected in the sparkling waters of the lagoon under a blue Adriatic sky has been painted,
                   photographed, and filmed to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish the real city from its romantic representations.
                   The visitor arriving in Venice is still transported into another world, one whose atmosphere and beauty remain incomparable.
